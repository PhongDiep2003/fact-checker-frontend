# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Fact Checker

## ‚ú® Introduction
Welcome to the Fact Checker application! This platform is designed to empower users with the ability to fact-check speeches, videos, and articles at lightning speed. Whether it‚Äôs analyzing YouTube videos or written articles, Fact Checker provides detailed claims, sources, and accurate ratings to help you uncover the truth instantly.

## üí° Why Was This Created?
In the era of misinformation, having quick and reliable tools to verify information is essential. This project was developed to address the growing need for fact-checking platforms that allow users to validate content across different media types. By automating the verification process, we aim to save time and provide transparency.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What This Can Do
- Extract transcripts from YouTube videos and analyze them for key phrases.
- Retrieve and process articles to identify claims based on user-defined topics.
- Provide sources from verified news outlets relevant to the extracted claims.
- Rate the validity of claims using generative AI to categorize them as **True**, **False**, **Misleading**, or **Unsure**.

## üõ†Ô∏è What I Am Made Of
This application leverages a variety of technologies and APIs to deliver fast and reliable fact-checking results:
- **Frontend**: Built with **Next.js** and **React**, styled using **Tailwind CSS**.
- **Backend**: Flask-based API to process YouTube transcripts and articles, and communicate with the generative AI model.
- **YouTube Transcript API**: For fetching transcripts of videos.
- **The News API**: Retrieves relevant news sources.
- **Generative AI (Google Gemini)**: To verify the extracted claims.
- **BeautifulSoup**: Scrapes article content for analysis.
- **SpaCy NLP**: Extracts claims and keywords from text.
- **CORS-Enabled**: Ensures cross-origin requests work seamlessly across domains.
